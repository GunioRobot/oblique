h1. Welcome to Obtweet

This is the Ruby code that powers "http://twitter.com/oblique":http://twitter.com/oblique.  Very simple code that you can use to post a randomly chosen message to a Twitter account, for instance from a list of your favorite quotes.  You should only need to modify the .yml files and create a cron job to run the script periodically.

*Update 9/26/08:* Using "Twitter4R gem":http://twitter4r.rubyforge.org/, and moving Twitter acct info into twitter.yml file.
